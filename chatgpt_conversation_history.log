2023-01-21 17:24:14,497 - INFO - :: ChatGPT: 

The exact number of stars in the universe is impossible to determine, as it is constantly changing due to the formation of new stars and the destruction of old ones. However, it is estimated that there are between 100 billion and 1 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing an average of 100 billion stars. This means that the total number of stars in the universe could range from 10 sextillion (10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) to 1 septillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).

2023-01-21 17:25:03,436 - INFO - :: ChatGPT: 

A black hole is an extremely dense celestial object with an intense gravitational pull that traps light and matter, preventing them from escaping. Black holes are formed when a massive star collapses in on itself, leaving behind a small, dense core. The gravity of the black hole is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull.

2023-01-21 17:25:22,077 - INFO - :: ChatGPT: 

When you are five years old, it can be hard to understand some things. So, if I were to explain something to you, I would use simple words and examples that you can relate to. For example, if I were to explain the internet to you, I would say that it is like a big library filled with books, videos, and pictures that anyone can access from anywhere in the world.

2023-01-21 17:25:56,286 - INFO - :: ChatGPT: 

The singularity is a point in space-time where the laws of physics break down, and the event horizon is the point of no return for matter and energy falling into a black hole.

2023-01-21 17:26:59,772 - INFO - :: ChatGPT: 

If a human were to approach a black hole, they would be pulled in by the immense gravitational force of the black hole and would eventually be crushed by the immense gravity. It is impossible to escape a black hole once you are within its event horizon.
